## HOW WAS THE SHELL IMPLEMENTED

I searched the internet to understand how a shell should work, then i used the manual and the internet to learn the most common system calls and c library function. At that point i started writing the code feature by feature.

## IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

I wrote some library functions by myself whenever i thought it was appropriate and useful for my implementation, those functions start with a "my". Whenever i use a library function is because i understood i was able to write that function but i thought it was wasteful.
